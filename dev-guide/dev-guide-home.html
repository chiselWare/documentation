  <h1>chiselWare Developers Guide</h1>

  <p>
    The chiselWare Developers Guide (CWDG) defines the methodology and minimum standards for developing chiselWare-compliant IP cores. Its purpose is to create consistency, quality, and predictability across a community-maintained library of reusable hardware IP written in Chisel.  A core that claims “chiselWare-compliant” is expected to follow this guide—not only for naming and directory conventions, but also for verification rigor, documentation completeness, and repeatable build and regression practices.
