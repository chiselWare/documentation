  <h1>chiselWare Developers Guide</h1>

  <p>
    <strong><a href="https://chisel-lang.org">Chisel</a></strong> is modern language for designing digital logic, based on the <strong><a href="https://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a></strong> software programming language. Chisel is an expressive language that provides hardware designers capabilities to describe hardware that are lacking in traditional HDLs such as Verilog, SystemVerilog, and VHDL.
  </p>

  <p>
    chiselWare&reg; refers to hardware IP cores written in the Chisel language and developed according to a strict, commercial-grade development methodology. Cores passing certification are published in the IP Factory&trade; and made available to users for download and incorporation into their designs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chiselWare Developers Guide defines the methodology and minimum standards for developing chiselWare-compliant IP cores. Its purpose is to create consistency, quality, and predictability across a community-maintained library of reusable hardware IP written in Chisel.  A core that claims “chiselWare-compliant” is expected to follow this guide— not only for naming and directory conventions, but also for verification rigor, documentation completeness, and repeatable build and regression practices. Compliance is enforced by the release management system (CI/CD) of the IP Factory and GitHub.
